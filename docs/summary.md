üì¶ Complete Package Summary
I've created a comprehensive system for your RiBau dog shelter catalog with the following components:

### Core Implementation Files:

- .github/workflows/sync-sheets.yml - GitHub Action that runs every 30 minutes to sync Google Sheets data
- scripts/sync-sheets.js - Node.js script that fetches from Google Sheets API and converts to CSV
- src/components/ProductCatalog.vue - Main catalog component with filtering
- src/components/ProductCard.vue - Individual product card with 3-image carousel
- src/components/ContactForm.vue - Modal contact form for inquiries
- package.json - Dependencies configuration

### Documentation Files:

- SETUP_GUIDE.md - Complete step-by-step setup instructions (Google Cloud, GitHub, etc.)

- GOOGLE_SHEETS_TEMPLATE.md - Google Sheets structure, examples, and volunteer guide
- README.md - Implementation summary and overview
- WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md - Visual workflow diagrams and quick reference

### Key Features: 
‚úÖ Non-technical volunteers manage products via Google Sheets \
‚úÖ You manage images via GitHub (simple git workflow) \
‚úÖ Automatic sync every 30 minutes \
‚úÖ 3-image carousel per product with smooth navigation \
‚úÖ Completely free for your scale (50 products, low traffic) \
‚úÖ Well-documented with guides for both you and volunteers \
‚úÖ Maintainable code split into logical components 

### Your Workflow:

1. Volunteer sends you 1-3 images
2. You rename them (001_1.jpg, 001_2.jpg) and commit to GitHub
3. Volunteer adds product to Google Sheet with that ID
4. Website auto-updates within 30 minutes

Everything is ready to deploy! Start with the SETUP_GUIDE.md and follow it step-by-step. The setup should take about 45 minutes total, and then it runs automatically forever. üêæ
